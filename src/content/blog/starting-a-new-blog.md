# Starting a new blog

Some day in 2011 I thought it was a good idea to code a blog **from scratch** using plain old PHP, HTML and some CSS - without any frameworks, plugins, or preprocessors. Not gonna lie, this thing had some nice features: categories, comments, an archive and a really ugly `<textarea>` to write the posts. That's were it all started. I wrote about tech news, software, games and movies - good times back then! A year later or so I switched to Wordpress, and at the end of 2013 I wrote the last article.

Ten years later it's time to start something new! This time it's all about dev topics. :tada:
